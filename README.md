### ✅ Python Libraries (ML, DL, Web, Cyber)

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras nltk opencv-python pycryptodome bcrypt cryptography scapy flask django fastapi networkx
```

### ✅ System Tools (for Linux/Arch)

```bash
sudo pacman -S bash netcat wireshark nmap tmux docker
```

### 🐳 For Docker usage:
